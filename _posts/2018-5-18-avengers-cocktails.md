With the summer cocktail season coming and _Avengers: Infinity Wars_ doing _ok_ at the box office my wife and I were thinking of fun ideas for a party. An _Avengers_-themed cocktail party seemed like a great opportunity. I understand there are likely some existing ideas for this, but I figured I'd make my own contributions instead of linking to them.

# Dr. Strange

With Dr. Strange we have a wizard of orange magic played by a very British actor and whose origin story involves a trip to exotic regions of Asia and a hefty dose of bitterness. So the Dr. Strange is a twist on the Pegu, which also manages to be one of my favorite and highly under-served gin cocktails:

### Recipe: (use half-shot for each 'part')
* 4 parts your favorite Gin
* 1 part Aperol 
* 1 part Triple Sec (preferably Cointreau)
* 1 dash lime juice
* 1 dash Angostura Bitters
* 1 dash Orange Bitters

Add all ingredients to shaker filled with ice, shake precisely in tight circles, garnish with a wedge of lime and a flourish of arrogance.

### Variations:
This drink is gin-forward, so choose what you like best, although heavily-floral gins may wind up too bitter when combined with the Aperol and bitters. The bitters also provide a lot of room for customization - grapefruit or citrus bitters could certainly be used.
