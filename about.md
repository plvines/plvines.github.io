# About Me:
## Cybersecurity Researcher:

I recently joined the Cyber and Communications Technologies division of BAE Systems in Arlington, VA. There I work on a variety of cybersecurity-related research projects, so far mostly involving networking security.

Prior to joining BAE Systems I graduated with Ph.D. from the University of Washington Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering. There I studied under Yoshi Kohno and Franzi Roesner in the [Security & Privacy Research Lab](https://seclab.cs.washington.edu/). My thesis focused on digital surveillance: measurements of existing surveillance; systems for circumventing surveillance; and exploration of novel methods of surveillance.

I chose to pursue security research for a few reasons. First, I think the problems that the field looks to solve are important, evening pressing, to solve for the safety of everyone touched by modern technology. Second, I enjoy the breadth of topics security touches on, which gives me an opportunity to constantly learn new subjects, from compilers to machine learning algorithms. Finally, I find the adversarial mindset needed for effective security research fascinating to switch to and from compared to the typical problem-solving development mindset.

## Person:

Aside from cybersecurity, I also enjoy a variety of eclectic and unrelated activities.

- Acrobatic Tricking
  + Sort of a mashup of the flashy moves from different martial arts and tumbling.
  + Formerly did some Capoeira
  + Formerly did some Parkour/Freerunning
- Breakdancing
- Boardgaming
  + Particular favorite right now is Agricola, but some others include Splendor, Terra Mystica, and Diplomacy. Have yet to be convinced that cooperative boardgames make sense.
- Juggling (Clubs and Balls, maybe Torches next?)
- History
  + [Mike Duncan's Revolutions Podcast](http://www.revolutionspodcast.com/) currently soaks up about half my commuting time.
